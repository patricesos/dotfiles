LONG DESCRIPTION
    This module provides easy access to the pallettes of Catppuccin. 
    
    This module exports a hashtable named $Catppuccin that contains the 
    pallettes of Catppuccin. The keys of the hashtable are the names of the
    pallettes.
    
    The pallettes are:
        Latte,
        Frappe,
        Macchiato,
        Mocha
    
    The pallettes are objects that contain the colours of the pallette. The 
    keys of the pallette objects are the names of the colours. The pallettes
    also contain methods to convert output the whole pallette in a few formats.

    The colours are:
        Rosewater,
        Flamingo,
        Pink,
        Mauve,
        Red,
        Maroon,
        Peach,
        Yellow,
        Green,
        Teal,
        Sky,
        Sapphire,
        Blue,
        Lavender,
        Text,
        Subtext1,
        Subtext0,
        Overlay2,
        Overlay1,
        Overlay0,
        Surface2,
        Surface1,
        Surface0,
        Base,
        Mantle,
        Crust
    
    The pallettes can be printed to the console in the following formats:
        Table - Prints the pallette details in a table
        Blocks - Prints a coloured block for each colour in the pallette
    
    The colours are objects that contain the RGB values of the colour, as well 
    as methods to convert the RGB values to other colour formats.

    The colours can be converted to the following formats:
        RGB - Returns the RGB values of the colour
        Hex - Returns the Hex value of the colour
        Foreground - Returns the colour as an ANSI foreground colour
        Background - Returns the colour as an ANSI background colour

    The colour class's ToString() method is overridden to return the Hex value

EXAMPLES
    Importing the Module: 
    Import-Module Catppuccin

    The Module exports a variable named $Catppuccin

    Accessing the Pallettes (e.g.): 

    $Catppuccin["Frappe"].Green.RGB()
    $Catppuccin["Macchiato"].Mauve.Hex()
    $Catppuccin["Latte"].Rosewater.Foreground()
    $Catppuccin["Mocha"].Blue.Background()

NOTES
    It might be preferable to set a default flavour of Catppuccin to use in your
    profile/script. For example, if you want to use the Latte flavour of 
    Catppuccin, you can add the following to your profile/script:

    $Flavour = $Catppuccin["Latte"]

    This will set the $Flavour variable to the Latte flavour of Catppuccin.
    You can then use the colours in the $Flavour variable like so:

    $Flavour.Rosewater.Foreground()
